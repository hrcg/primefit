# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project involves recreating the existing Shopify store (ASRV.com) as a WordPress theme with WooCommerce integration. The goal is to achieve pixel-perfect design replication while maintaining WordPress best practices, optimal performance, and scalability. The new site must provide equivalent functionality to the current Shopify store while leveraging WooCommerce's e-commerce capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Design Replication and Responsive Layout

**User Story:** As a site visitor, I want the WordPress site to look and feel identical to the current ASRV.com Shopify store, so that I have a consistent brand experience across platforms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits any page THEN the design SHALL match the current Shopify theme pixel-for-pixel where technically feasible
2. WHEN a user accesses the site on desktop, tablet, or mobile THEN the layout SHALL be fully responsive and maintain design integrity
3. WHEN the site loads THEN all CSS SHALL be modular and organized with no inline styles
4. WHEN examining the theme structure THEN it SHALL follow WordPress theme standards including header.php, footer.php, functions.php, and template hierarchy

### Requirement 2: WooCommerce E-commerce Integration

**User Story:** As a customer, I want to browse products, add items to cart, and complete purchases seamlessly, so that I can shop with the same functionality as the original Shopify store.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user browses products THEN WooCommerce SHALL handle all product display, cart, checkout, and account functionality
2. WHEN a user views product pages THEN all product variations, options, and details SHALL be displayed identically to Shopify equivalents
3. WHEN a user filters or searches products THEN the functionality SHALL match the current Shopify collection and filtering system
4. WHEN examining WooCommerce templates THEN they SHALL be customized to match Shopify design without modifying core WooCommerce files
5. WHEN a user navigates categories THEN WooCommerce product categories SHALL replicate Shopify collections structure

### Requirement 3: Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a site visitor, I want the WordPress site to load quickly and perform efficiently, so that I have a smooth browsing experience without delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the theme is activated THEN it SHALL contain no bloated plugins or unnecessary dependencies
2. WHEN database queries execute THEN they SHALL be optimized and avoid custom queries unless absolutely necessary
3. WHEN assets load THEN CSS and JavaScript SHALL be lightweight and loaded only where needed
4. WHEN the site serves content THEN it SHALL implement caching, lazy loading, and minification following WordPress best practices
5. WHEN performance is measured THEN page load times SHALL be optimized for both desktop and mobile devices

### Requirement 4: WordPress Best Practices Compliance

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the site, I want the code to follow WordPress standards and conventions, so that the site is maintainable, secure, and compatible with WordPress ecosystem.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining the file structure THEN it SHALL follow proper WordPress theme directory structure in wp-content/themes/
2. WHEN scripts and styles are loaded THEN they SHALL be enqueued via functions.php using wp_enqueue_script and wp_enqueue_style
3. WHEN customizing WooCommerce THEN overrides SHALL use hooks and filters instead of editing core files
4. IF a parent theme is used THEN a child theme structure SHALL be implemented for customizations
5. WHEN integrating with WordPress THEN all functionality SHALL use WordPress APIs and hooks appropriately

### Requirement 5: Code Quality and Maintainability

**User Story:** As a future developer working on this site, I want clean, well-documented, and modular code, so that I can easily understand, modify, and extend the functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the codebase THEN all code SHALL be clean, properly commented, and modular
2. WHEN configuration is needed THEN WordPress settings and options SHALL be used instead of hardcoded values
3. WHEN additional functionality is required THEN custom post types or ACF SHALL only be used where WooCommerce doesn't provide the feature
4. WHEN examining the code structure THEN it SHALL be organized for scalability and future development
5. WHEN making changes THEN the modular structure SHALL allow modifications without affecting other components

### Requirement 6: SEO and Accessibility Standards

**User Story:** As a site visitor using assistive technology or search engines, I want the site to be accessible and SEO-optimized, so that I can navigate effectively and the site ranks well in search results.
